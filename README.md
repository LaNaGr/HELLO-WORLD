# HELLO-WORLD
## THE FIRST REPO
_Today is 2022/05/16. In the **First Month** of being stuck in university, Iâ€™m working on my project and talking on the phone every day._
_Nothing good happen, but luckily there is nothing terrible._
_OK, I will stop nagging and start to concentrate on my day._

---
_**PS:** Feeling sleepy. It makes me happy that I have learned about a new word "self-fullfilling prophecy" this night._
